        <h2>The sigital pets, which first hit shelves in Japan in 1996, quickly became a global phenomenon following their worldwide release the following year. Kids whose parents got them one of these needy little keychain creatures may have been delighted at first. But who doesn't remember the crushing feeling of finding out that their digital pet had died because they didn't find time to feed it between math class and gym?. </h2>
